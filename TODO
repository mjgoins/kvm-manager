TODO for KVM-Manager
--------------------

 * (much) better documentation

 * file re-organization/restructuring

 * debian packaging?

 * more flexibility with networking (currently only supports
   tun/tap-style bridging)

 * /usr/local/sbin is hard-coded in places (e.g. in the run and finish
   scripts); it probably shouldn't be.

 * screen logging is still sub-par, and could potentially fill the host
   disks if the kernel spew is immense -- rotate?  filter through
   svlogd somehow?  same problem as cereal.

 * how do we send break signals over the serial line in the new setup?

 * we aren't currently supervising the console screen well.  if the
   user kills it, it will be gone.

 * can we separate the privileges for the monitor from the privs for
   the console?

 + * can we start up the console screen first, listening on a UNIX
   socket, and then launch kvm with the console as a client instead
   (so that it works the other way around)?

 * can we get our logs to be timestamped?

 * di-maker fails if you give a full path to the iso.

 * allow handing a kernel + initramfs to the guest as a special case
   of booting
